# Sentiment Analysis on Airline Tweets
## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques applied to a dataset of airline tweets. The goal is to classify the sentiment of airline passengers' tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights into customer satisfaction and sentiment trends within the airline industry.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of tweets directed at various airlines, along with their corresponding sentiment labels. It includes attributes such as the airline name, tweet text, and sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral). The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed here.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing: The raw tweet text is preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters, URLs, and stop words. Text normalization techniques such as tokenization and lemmatization are applied.
### Feature Engineering: Textual features are extracted from the preprocessed tweet text using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and word embeddings.
### Model Building: Several machine learning and deep learning models are trained and evaluated for sentiment classification, including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer-based models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
### Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to ensure robustness and generalization.
